# WEPPCLIFF MANUAL

## METADATA:

	Author:		Ryan P. McGehee
	Modified:	30 April 2020

## PURPOSE:

	Provide a manual of WEPPCLIFF syntax, which is easily accessible.

## NOTES:

	WEPPCLIFF is always being improved, which means that its functions and
	syntax may change over time, but changes are only made when absolutely
	necessary. Most commands, especially core functionality, will not change
	much over time.
	
	As of WEPPCLIFF Version 1.4 automated gap filling and quality checking
	routines were determined to be satisfactory for publication, but they
	are not perfect. In the near future, these routines will be evaluated
	and published in scientific literature to provide a more complete
	understanding of their capabilities and limitations.

	KEEP THESE NOTES IN MIND FOR UNDERSTANDING THE CURRENT CAPABILITIES OF
	WEPPCLIFF AS WELL AS THOSE TO BE INCLUDED IN FUTURE RELEASES.
